This project consisted of reading multiple related data files, assembling these 'components' into into a single coherent dataframe, creating a summary of the dataset and writing the summary to a plain text file.

The entire process is accomplished by running the code in the run_analysis.R file.

### Downloading the data
The archived data was downloaded from the following URL:  
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
This this archive was unzipped producing a directory (UCI HAR Dataset) containing all the raw data files.

### The raw data is contained in plain text files as follows:  
- The **features.txt** file contain the dataset variable (column) names. 
- The **activity_labels.txt** file contain the activity corresponding to the numeric coded activity in the y_test and y_train data files.  
- The **subjext_test.txt** and **subject_train.txt** files contain the subjectid for each of the measurements in the test and train datasets, respectively.  
- The **y_test.txt** and **y_train.txt** files contain the numeric coded values of the activity for each measurement.  
- The **X_test.txt** and **X_train.txt** files contain the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements in fixed width columns of 16 characters.

### Reading data files and assembling the dataset
- Each of the above files were read into dataframes using the read.table() function.  
- The subject, y (activity) and X (measurements) were combined in a column-wise manner using the cbind() function.
- The same process was utilized for both the test and train datasets.  
- The test and train datasets were combined in a row-wise fashion using the rbind() function.  
- The column names were applied using the values from the features.txt file. 
- Once the combinedData dataframe was constructed the above dataframes were deleted.  

### Transform the combined dataframe
- Converted the activity column from integer values to the corresponding activity labels using a simple custom look up function.  
- Converted the activity column to a factor variable.  
- Utilized the dplyr select function and a regular expression to select columns that contained mean or std.  
- Removed the parentheses if present in the column names using text substitution.  

### Create separate summary dataframe of column mean values
- Grouped by activity and subjectid and summarized the rest of the columns using the mean function. 
- Wrote the dataframe to the text file summary.txt
